Hi Antonio and Andy,

We will be discussing this email during our meeting. Essentially, we want
to see if you think we can make a script that would pull the names, title
and link to the paper if they match certain keywords and have it
automatically feed into an excel or google sheet.


Thank you,
Cynthia

*1.* Incentive-Compatible Critical Values
<https://www.nber.org/papers/w29702?utm_campaign=3Dntwh&utm_medium=3Demail&=
utm_source=3Dntwg15>
Adam McCloskey and Pascal Michaillat #29702

*Abstract:*

Statistically significant results are more rewarded than insignificant
ones, so researchers have the incentive to pursue statistical significance.
Such p-hacking reduces the informativeness of hypothesis tests by making
significant results much more common than they are supposed to be in the
absence of true significance. To address this problem, we construct
critical values of test statistics such that, if these values are used to
determine significance, and if researchers optimally respond to these new
significance standards, then significant results occur with the desired
frequency. Such incentive-compatible critical values allow for p-hacking so
they are larger than classical critical values. Using evidence from the
social and medical sciences, we find that the incentive-compatible critical
value for any test and any significance level is the classical critical
value for the same test with approximately one fifth of the significance
level=E2=80=94a form of Bonferroni correction! . For instance, for a z-test=
 with a
significance level of 5%, the incentive-compatible critical value is 2.31
instead of 1.65 if the test is one-sided and 2.57 instead of 1.96 if the
test is two-sided.


*2.* Should We Have Automatic Triggers for Unemployment Benefit Duration
And How Costly Would They Be?
<https://www.nber.org/papers/w29703?utm_campaign=3Dntwh&utm_medium=3Demail&=
utm_source=3Dntwg15>
Gabriel Chodorow-Reich, Peter Ganong, and Jonathan Gruber #29703

*Abstract:*

We model automatic trigger policies for unemployment insurance by
simulating a weekly panel of individual labor market histories, grouped by
state. We reach three conclusions: (i) policies designed to trigger
immediately at the onset of a recession result in benefit extensions that
occur in less sick labor markets than the historical average for benefit
extensions; (ii) the ad hoc extensions in the 2001 and 2007-09 recessions
in total cover a similar number of additional weeks as common proposals for
automatic triggers, but concentrate coverage more in weaker labor markets;
(iii) compared to ex post policy, the cost of common proposals for
automatic triggers is close to zero.


*3.* Waiting for Capital: Dynamic Intermediation in Illiquid Markets
<https://www.nber.org/papers/w29712?utm_campaign=3Dntwh&utm_medium=3Demail&=
utm_source=3Dntwg15>
Barney Hartman-Glaser, Simon Mayer, and Konstantin Milbradt #29712

*Abstract:*

We consider a firm with infrequent access to capital markets, continuous
access to financing by a risk-averse intermediary, and a cost of holding
cash. The intermediary absorbs a fraction of cash-flow risk that decreases
with the firm=E2=80=99s liquidity reserves and acquires a stake in the firm=
 under
distress. Implementing the optimal contract suggests an overlapping pecking
order. The firm simultaneously finances shortfalls with cash reserves and a
credit line and sells equity to the intermediary when it runs out of cash.
The model helps explain empirical facts and trends in financial
intermediation, such as the rise of private equity.


*4.* Addressing Endogeneity Using a Two-stage Copula Generated Regressor
Approach
<https://www.nber.org/papers/w29708?utm_campaign=3Dntwh&utm_medium=3Demail&=
utm_source=3Dntwg15>
Fan Yang, Yi Qian, and Hui Xie #29708

*Abstract:*

A prominent challenge when drawing causal inference using observational
data is the ubiquitous presence of endogenous regressors. The classical
econometric method to handle regressor endogeneity requires instrumental
variables that must satisfy the stringent condition of exclusion
restriction, making it infeasible to use in many settings. We propose new
instrument-free methods using copulas to address the endogeneity problem.
The existing copula correction method focuses only on the endogenous
regressors and may yield biased estimates when exogenous and endogenous
regressors are correlated. Furthermore, (nearly) normally distributed
endogenous regressors cause model non-identification or finite-sample poor
performance. Our proposed two-stage copula endogeneity correction (2sCOPE)
method simultaneously overcomes the two key limitations and yields
consistent causal-effect estimates with correlated endogenous and exogenous
regressors as well as normally distributed endogenous r! egressors. 2sCOPE
employs generated regressors derived from existing regressors to control
for endogeneity, and is straightforward to use and broadly applicable.
Moreover, we prove that exploiting correlated exogenous regressors can
address the problem of insufficient regressor non-normality, relax
identification requirements and improve estimation precision (by as much as
=E2=88=BC50% in empirical evaluation). Overall, 2sCOPE can greatly increase=
 the
ease of and broaden the applicability of instrument-free methods for
dealing with regressor endogeneity. We demonstrate the performance of
2sCOPE via simulation studies and an empirical application.


*5.* Two-Way Fixed Effects and Differences-in-Differences with
Heterogeneous Treatment Effects: A Survey
<https://www.nber.org/papers/w29691?utm_campaign=3Dntwh&utm_medium=3Demail&=
utm_source=3Dntwg15>
Cl=C3=A9ment de Chaisemartin and Xavier D'Haultfoeuille #29691

*Abstract:*

Linear regressions with period and group fixed effects are widely used to
estimate policies' effects: 26 of the 100 most cited papers published by
the American Economic Review from 2015 to 2019 estimate such regressions.
It has recently been show that those regressions may produce misleading
estimates, if the policy's effect is heterogeneous between groups or over
time, as is often the case. This survey reviews a fast-growing literature
that documents this issue, and that proposes alternative estimators robust
to heterogeneous effects.


*6.* Education and Income Gradients in Longevity: The Role of Policy
<https://www.nber.org/papers/w29694?utm_campaign=3Dntwh&utm_medium=3Demail&=
utm_source=3Dntwg15>
Adriana Lleras-Muney #29694

*Abstract:*

Education and income are strong predictors of health and longevity. In the
last 20 years many efforts have been made to understand if these
relationships are causal and what the possible role of policy should be as
a result. The evidence from various studies is ambiguous: the effects of
education and income policies on health are heterogeneous and vary over
time, and across places and populations. I discuss explanations for these
disparate results and suggest directions for future research.


*7.* The (Un)Importance of Inheritance
<https://www.nber.org/papers/w29693?utm_campaign=3Dntwh&utm_medium=3Demail&=
utm_source=3Dntwg15>
Sandra E. Black, Paul J. Devereux, Fanny Landaud, and Kjell G. Salvanes
#29693

*Abstract:*

Transfers from parents=E2=80=94either in the form of gifts or inheritances=
=E2=80=94have
received much attention as a source of inequality. This paper uses a
19-year panel of administrative data for the population of Norway to
examine the share of the Total Inflows available to an individual (defined
as the capitalized sum of net labor income, government transfers, and gifts
and inheritances received over the period) accounted for by capitalized
gifts and inheritances. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that gifts and
inheritances represent a small share of Total Inflows; this is true across
the distribution of Total Inflows, as well as at all levels of net wealth
at a point in time. Gifts and inheritances are only an important source of
income flows among those who have very wealthy parents. Additionally, gifts
and inheritances have very little effect on the distribution of Total
Inflows =E2=80=93 when we do a counterfactual Total Inflows distribution wi=
th zero
gifts and inheritances, it is not ! much different from the actual
distribution. Our findings suggest that inheritance taxes may do little to
mitigate the extreme wealth inequality in society.


*8.* Currency Undervaluation and Comparative Advantage
<https://www.nber.org/papers/w29699?utm_campaign=3Dntwh&utm_medium=3Demail&=
utm_source=3Dntwg15>
Paul Bergin #29699

*Abstract:*

This paper highlights a tradeoff implied by a policy of export-led growth
through currency undervaluation. While undervaluation can foster domestic
manufacturing in countries like China by sustaining trade surplus, it also
can harm a country=E2=80=99s comparative advantage by altering the composit=
ion of
exports. Undervaluation may discourage specializing in high-value added
manufacturing and instead favor specialization in non-differentiated goods
with higher price elasticity. A dynamic general equilibrium model of two
traded good sectors and capital account restrictions shows that
undervaluation can either raise or lower welfare depending on two competing
effects on comparative advantage: agglomeration versus an elasticity
effect.


*9.* Making Money
<https://www.nber.org/papers/w29710?utm_campaign=3Dntwh&utm_medium=3Demail&=
utm_source=3Dntwg15>
Gary B. Gorton, Chase P. Ross, and Sharon Y. Ross #29710

*Abstract:*

It is difficult for private agents to produce money that circulates at par
with no questions asked. We study two cases of privately-produced money:
pre-Civil War U.S. private banknotes and modern stablecoins. Private monies
are introduced when there are no better alternatives, but they initially
carry an inconvenience yield. Over time, these monies may become more
money-like, but they do not always achieve a positive convenience yield.
Technology advances and reputation formation pushed private banknotes
toward a positive convenience yield. We show that the same forces are at
work for stablecoins.


*10.* Ageing and Welfare-State Policy: Macroeconomic Perspective
<https://www.nber.org/papers/w29700?utm_campaign=3Dntwh&utm_medium=3Demail&=
utm_source=3Dntwg15>
Assaf Razin and Alexander Horst Schwemmer #29700

*Abstract:*

It has been well recognized that population ageing could generate
structural changes centered around the dwindling labor force, on one hand,
and the expanding dependency on the generosity of the welfare state, on the
other hand. Ageing-related welfare state policy entails both fiscal issues
and migration issues. The paper employs a general-equilibrium model with a
policy-making focus, to help understand the mechanism governing the
provision of social benefits, labor income taxation, capital income
taxation, migration curbs on low skilled and high skilled, driven by the
ageing of the population. Greater generosity of the welfare state comes
together with policy-- incentive compatible with the interests of the
majority voters-- of a more liberal migration policy. Effects of ageing on
the tax and benefit sides of the welfare state depends on the size of
dependents in the population and on whether the country is a capital
importer (in which case the capital tax burden is sha! red with foreigners)
or a capital exporter (in which case the age-related wage increase skews
taxation towards labor income). Low ageing evolution correlates with a
relatively labor-abundant country (low retirement) turns into labor-scarce
country (high retirement). Parallel to the evolution of the labor force, a
capital-importer country (high rate of return) becomes capital-exporter
(low rate of return). Greater ageing-related demand for social benefits is
balanced against the rising cost of labor income taxation, and capital
income taxation.


*11.* Expectations Formation and Forward Information
<https://www.nber.org/papers/w29711?utm_campaign=3Dntwh&utm_medium=3Demail&=
utm_source=3Dntwg15>
Nathan Goldstein and Yuriy Gorodnichenko #29711

*Abstract:*

We propose a model where forecasters have access to noisy signals about the
future (forward information). In this setting, information varies not only
across agents but also across horizons. As a result, estimated persistence
of forecasts deviates from persistence of fundamentals and the ability of
forecasts at shorter horizons to explain forecasts at longer horizons is
limited. These properties tend to diminish as the forecast horizon
increases. We document that this novel pattern is consistent with survey
data for professional forecasters. We provide further evidence that
time-series and cross-sectional variation in professional forecasts is
driven by forward information. We propose a simple method for extracting
the forward information component from survey and provide several
applications of forward information.


*12.* Idiosyncratic Income Risk and Aggregate Fluctuations
<https://www.nber.org/papers/w29704?utm_campaign=3Dntwh&utm_medium=3Demail&=
utm_source=3Dntwg15>
Davide Debortoli and Jordi Gal=C3=AD #29704

*Abstract:*

We study the role of idiosyncratic income shocks for aggregate fluctuations
within a simple heterogeneous household framework with no binding borrowing
constraints. We show that the presence of idiosyncratic income shocks
affects the economy=E2=80=99s response to an aggregate shock in a way that =
can be
captured by a consumption weighted average of the changes in uncertainty
generated by the shock. We apply this framework to two example economies
=E2=80=94an endowment economy and a New Keynesian economy=E2=80=94 and show=
 that under
plausible calibrations the impact of idiosyncratic income shocks on
aggregate fluctuations is quantitatively small, since most of the changes
in uncertainty are concentrated among poorer (low consumption) households.


*13.* Does Quitting Smoking Increase Obesity? Evidence From Accounting for
Misreporting
<https://www.nber.org/papers/w29701?utm_campaign=3Dntwh&utm_medium=3Demail&=
utm_source=3Dntwg15>
Rusty Tchernis, Keith F. Teltser, and Arjun Teotia #29701

*Abstract:*

Smoking and obesity are the two leading causes of preventable deaths in the
United States. Because smoking is subject to heavy government intervention,
understanding the effect of smoking on obesity is important in determining
the extent of unintended costs or benefits of such intervention. The
existing literature on this question is mixed among studies using
experimental and observational data, which we attempt to reconcile by
accounting for misreporting in observational data. We use self-reported
data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), cigarette
taxes to instrument for changes in smoking, and survey completion to
instrument for misreporting. Starting with the baseline two-stage least
squares (2SLS) estimator common in the earlier observational literature, we
obtain similar estimates suggesting quitting smoking substantially reduces
BMI. However, we find the results are sensitive to specification,
functional form, and the presence of misreporting. ! We show that
accounting for misreporting using the 2-step estimator developed by
Nguimkeu et al. (2019) yields estimates consistent with the experimental
literature; quitting smoking has a small positive effect on BMI. Our
preferred estimate suggests reduced smoking accounts for 6% of the
concurrent rise in obesity.


*14.* Labor Market Fluidity and Human Capital Accumulation
<https://www.nber.org/papers/w29698?utm_campaign=3Dntwh&utm_medium=3Demail&=
utm_source=3Dntwg15>
Niklas Engbom #29698

*Abstract:*

Using panel data from 23 OECD countries, I document that wages grow more
over the life-cycle in countries where job-to-job mobility is more common.
A life-cycle theory of job shopping and accumulation of skills on the job
highlights that a more fluid labor market allows workers to faster relocate
to jobs where they can better use their skills, incentivizing accumulation
of skills. Lower labor market fluidity reduces life-cycle wage growth by 20
percent and aggregate labor productivity by nine percent across the OECD
relative to the US. I derive a set of testable predictions for training and
confront them with comparable cross-country training data, finding support
for the theory.


*15.* Earnings Inequality and Dynamics in the Presence of Informality: The
Case of Brazil
<https://www.nber.org/papers/w29696?utm_campaign=3Dntwh&utm_medium=3Demail&=
utm_source=3Dntwg15>
Niklas Engbom, Gustavo Gonzaga, Christian Moser, and Roberta Olivieri
#29696

*Abstract:*

Using rich administrative and household survey data spanning 34 years from
1985 to 2018, we document a series of new facts on earnings inequality and
dynamics in a developing country with a large informal sector: Brazil.
Since the mid-1990s, both inequality and volatility of earnings have
declined significantly in Brazil=E2=80=99s formal sector. Higher-order mome=
nts of
the distribution of earnings changes show cyclical movements in Brazil that
are similar to those in developed countries like the US. Relative to the
formal sector, the informal sector is associated with a significant
earnings penalty and higher earnings volatility for identical workers.
Earnings changes of workers who switch from formal to informal (from
informal to formal) employment are relatively negative (positive) and large
in magnitude, dispersed, negatively (positively) skewed, and less
leptokurtic. Our results suggest that informal employment is an imperfect
insurance mechanism.


*16.* State-building on the Margin: An Urban Experiment in Medell=C3=ADn
<https://www.nber.org/papers/w29692?utm_campaign=3Dntwh&utm_medium=3Demail&=
utm_source=3Dntwg15>
Christopher Blattman, Gustavo Duncan, Benjamin Lessing, and Santiago Tobon
#29692

*Abstract:*

Medell=C3=ADn's government wanted to raise its efficacy, legitimacy, and
control. The city identified 80 neighborhoods with weak state presence and
competing armed actors. In half, they increased non-police street presence
tenfold for two years, offering social services and dispute resolution. In
places where the state was initially weakest, the intervention did not
work, mainly because the government struggled to deliver on its promises.
Where the state began stronger, the government raised opinions of its
services and legitimacy. If there are indeed low marginal returns to
investing in capacity in the least-governed areas, this could produce
increasing returns to state-building.


*17.* Firm Pay Dynamics
<https://www.nber.org/papers/w29697?utm_campaign=3Dntwh&utm_medium=3Demail&=
utm_source=3Dntwg15>
Niklas Engbom, Christian Moser, and Jan Sauermann #29697

*Abstract:*

We study the nature of firm pay dynamics. To this end, we propose a
statistical model that extends the seminal framework by Abowd, Kramarz and
Margolis (1999) to allow for idiosyncratically time-varying firm pay
policies. We estimate the model using linked employer-employee data for
Sweden from 1985 to 2016. By drawing on detailed firm financials data, we
show that firms that become more productive and accumulate capital raise
pay, whereas firms lower pay as they add workers. A secular increase in
firm-year pay dispersion in Sweden since 1985 is accounted for by greater
persistence of firm pay among incumbent firms as well as greater dispersion
in firm pay among entrant firms, as opposed to more volatile firm pay.


*18.* Why Are Returns to Private Business Wealth So Dispersed?
<https://www.nber.org/papers/w29705?utm_campaign=3Dntwh&utm_medium=3Demail&=
utm_source=3Dntwg15>
Corina Boar, Denis Gorea, and Virgiliu Midrigan #29705

*Abstract:*

We use micro data from Orbis on firm level balance sheets and income
statements to document that accounting returns for privately held
businesses are dispersed, persistent, and negatively correlated with firm
equity. We also show that firms experience large, fat-tailed, and partly
transitory changes in output that are not fully accompanied by changes in
their capital stock and wage bill. This implies that capital and labor
choices are risky, as fluctuations in output are accompanied by large
changes in firm profits. We interpret this evidence using a model of
entrepreneurial dynamics in which return heterogeneity can arise from both
limited span of control, as well as from financial frictions which generate
differences in financial returns to saving. The model matches the evidence
on accounting returns and predicts that financial returns to saving are
half as large and dispersed as accounting returns. Financial returns mostly
reflect risk, as opposed to collateral constrai! nts which play a
negligible role due to firms' unwillingness to expand and take on more
risk.


*19.* Economic Winners Versus Losers and the Unequal Pandemic Recession
<https://www.nber.org/papers/w29713?utm_campaign=3Dntwh&utm_medium=3Demail&=
utm_source=3Dntwg15>
Fernando Cirelli and Mark Gertler #29713

*Abstract:*

As is well known, during the pandemic recession firms directly exposed to
the virus, i.e. the =E2=80=9Ccontact=E2=80=9D sector, contracted sharply an=
d recovered
slowly relative to the rest of the economy. Less understood is how firms
that =E2=80=9Cwon=E2=80=9D by offering safer substitutes for contact sector=
 goods have
affected this unequal downturn. Using both firm and industry data, we first
construct disaggregated measures of revenue growth that distinguish between
contact sector losers, contact sector winners, and the non-contact sector.
We show that contact sector losers contracted roughly fifty percent more
than the sector average, while winners grew. Further, forecast data
suggests that the gap between winners and losers will persist at least
through 2022. To explain this evidence, we then develop a simple three
sector New Keynesian model with (i) a sector of firms that offers safe
substitutes for risky contact sector goods and (ii) learning by doing.
Overall, the model captures the unequal ! sectoral recession. It also
accounts for inflation, including the sharp runup in 2021.


*20.* Have Recreational Marijuana Laws Undermined Public Health Progress on
Adult Tobacco Use?
<https://www.nber.org/papers/w29706?utm_campaign=3Dntwh&utm_medium=3Demail&=
utm_source=3Dntwg15>
Dhaval M. Dave, Yang Liang, Michael F. Pesko, Serena Phillips, and Joseph
J. Sabia #29706

*Abstract:*

Public health experts caution that legalization of recreational marijuana
may normalize smoking and undermine the decades-long achievements of
tobacco control policy. However, very little is known about the impact of
recreational marijuana laws (RMLs) on adult tobacco use. Using information
from four national datasets (National Survey of Drug Use and Health,
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, Current Population
Survey-Tobacco Use Supplements, and Population Assessment of Tobacco and
Health) and dynamic difference-in-differences and discrete-time hazard
approaches, we find little support for the hypothesis that RML enactment
leads to increases in adult tobacco use. In the short-run, RMLs have no
effect on tobacco use and in the medium-run, we find some evidence of a
lagged reduction in tobacco use on the order of approximately 0.5 to 2
percentage points. This finding generally persists across cigarettes and
e-cigarettes, is robust to event-study analyses generate! d from estimators
designed to expunge bias due to heterogeneous dynamic treatment effects,
and persists in panel data-based survival analyses that account for
consumption dynamics. We conclude that fears of adult tobacco-related
public health costs from RMLs are, at least in the short- and medium-run,
unfounded; instead, there may be important public health benefits from
reductions in adult tobacco use.


*21.* When is TSLS Actually LATE?
<https://www.nber.org/papers/w29709?utm_campaign=3Dntwh&utm_medium=3Demail&=
utm_source=3Dntwg15>
Christine Blandhol, John Bonney, Magne Mogstad, and Alexander Torgovitsky
#29709

*Abstract:*

Linear instrumental variable estimators, such as two-stage least squares
(TSLS), are commonly interpreted as estimating positively weighted averages
of causal effects, referred to as local average treatment effects (LATEs).
We examine whether the LATE interpretation actually applies to the types of
TSLS specifications that are used in practice. We show that if the
specification includes covariates, which most empirical work does, then the
LATE interpretation does not apply in general. Instead, the TSLS estimator
will in general reflect treatment effects for both compliers and
always/never-takers, and some of the treatment effects for the
always/never-takers will necessarily be negatively weighted. We show that
the only specifications that have a LATE interpretation are "saturated"
specifications that control for covariates nonparametrically, implying that
such specifications are both sufficient and necessary for TSLS to have a
LATE interpretation, at least without additional! parametric assumptions.
This result is concerning because, as we document, empirical researchers
almost never control for covariates nonparametrically, and rarely discuss
or justify parametric specifications of covariates. We develop a
decomposition that quantifies the extent to which the usual LATE
interpretation fails. We apply the decomposition to four empirical analyses
and find strong evidence that the LATE interpretation of TSLS is far from
accurate for the types of specifications actually used in practice.


*22.* A Goldilocks Theory of Fiscal Deficits
<https://www.nber.org/papers/w29707?utm_campaign=3Dntwh&utm_medium=3Demail&=
utm_source=3Dntwg15>
Atif R. Mian, Ludwig Straub, and Amir Sufi #29707

*Abstract:*

This paper proposes a tractable framework to analyze fiscal space and the
dynamics of government debt, with a possibly binding zero lower bound (ZLB)
constraint. Without the ZLB, a greater primary deficit unambiguously raises
debt. However, debt need not explode: When R < G =E2=80=93 =CF=86, where =
=CF=86 is the
sensitivity of R =E2=80=93 G to debt, a modest permanent increase in the de=
ficit
can be sustained forever, a policy we call =E2=80=9Cfree lunch=E2=80=9D. Wi=
th the ZLB, the
relationship between deficit and debt can become non-monotone. Both high
and low deficits can increase debt, as the latter weaken demand and reduce
nominal growth at the ZLB. A rise in income inequality expands fiscal space
outside the ZLB, but contracts it at the ZLB. Calibrating the model, we
find little space for =E2=80=9Cfree lunch=E2=80=9D policies for the United =
States in 2019,
but ample space for Japan.


*23.* Traditional Supernatural Beliefs and Prosocial Behavior
<https://www.nber.org/papers/w29695?utm_campaign=3Dntwh&utm_medium=3Demail&=
utm_source=3Dntwg15>
Etienne Le Rossignol, Sara Lowes, and Nathan Nunn #29695

*Abstract:*

In sub-Saharan Africa, traditional supernatural beliefs, including belief
in witchcraft, black magic, or fetishism, are widespread. Some have
hypothesized that these beliefs help to sustain cooperative behavior in a
setting where the state is often absent. Others have documented that, at
least at a macro-level, such beliefs are negatively associated with
prosocial behavior. We contribute to a better understanding of the causal
effects of these traditional supernatural beliefs by using lab-in-the-field
experiments in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Participants complete
a range of experimental tasks where one player chooses whether to act in a
prosocial manner towards another player. Participants are randomly assigned
to another player that has either a strong or weak belief in witchcraft,
and this information is known by the players. We find that participants act
less prosocially towards randomly-assigned partners who believe more
strongly in witchcraft. We also find t! hat antisocial behavior is more
socially acceptable and prosocial behavior less socially acceptable when
playing with a partner who believes more strongly in witchcraft. Our
findings suggest that the negative relationship between witchcraft and
prosocial outcomes observed in the data may, in fact, be due to the causal
effect of the presence of traditional supernatural beliefs on people=E2=80=
=99s
behavior.*

Statistically significant results are more rewarded than insignificant ones=
, so researchers have the incentive to pursue statistical significance. Suc=
h p-hacking reduces the informativeness of hypothesis tests by making signi=
ficant results much more common than they are supposed to be in the absence=
 of true significance. To address this problem, we construct critical value=
s of test statistics such that, if these values are used to determine signi=
ficance, and if researchers optimally respond to these new significance sta=
ndards, then significant results occur with the desired frequency. Such inc=
entive-compatible critical values allow for p-hacking so they are larger th=
an classical critical values. Using evidence from the social and medical sc=
iences, we find that the incentive-compatible critical value for any test a=
nd any significance level is the classical critical value for the same test=
 with approximately one fifth of the significance level=E2=80=94a form of B=
onferroni correction!
 . For instance, for a z-test with a significance level of 5%, the incentiv=

<p>
A prominent challenge when drawing causal inference using observational dat=
a is the ubiquitous presence of endogenous regressors. The classical econom=
etric method to handle regressor endogeneity requires instrumental variable=
s that must satisfy the stringent condition of exclusion restriction, makin=
g it infeasible to use in many settings. We propose new instrument-free met=
hods using copulas to address the endogeneity problem. The existing copula =
correction method focuses only on the endogenous regressors and may yield b=
iased estimates when exogenous and endogenous regressors are correlated. Fu=
rthermore, (nearly) normally distributed endogenous regressors cause model =
non-identification or finite-sample poor performance. Our proposed two-stag=
e copula endogeneity correction (2sCOPE) method simultaneously overcomes th=
e two key limitations and yields consistent causal-effect estimates with co=
rrelated endogenous and exogenous regressors as well as normally distribute=
d endogenous r!
 egressors. 2sCOPE employs generated regressors derived from existing regre=
ssors to control for endogeneity, and is straightforward to use and broadly=
 applicable. Moreover, we prove that exploiting correlated exogenous regres=
sors can address the problem of insufficient regressor non-normality, relax=
 identification requirements and improve estimation precision (by as much a=
s =E2=88=BC50% in empirical evaluation). Overall, 2sCOPE can greatly increa=
se the ease of and broaden the applicability of instrument-free methods for=
 dealing with regressor endogeneity. We demonstrate the performance of 2sCO=
PE via simulation studies and an empirical application.

It has been well recognized that population ageing could generate structura=
l changes centered around the dwindling labor force, on one hand, and the e=
xpanding dependency on the generosity of the welfare state, on the other ha=
nd. Ageing-related welfare state policy entails both fiscal issues and migr=
ation issues. The paper employs a general-equilibrium model with a policy-m=
aking focus, to help  understand the  mechanism governing the provision of =
social benefits, labor income taxation, capital income taxation, migration =
curbs on low skilled and high skilled, driven by the ageing of the  populat=
ion. Greater generosity of the welfare state comes together with policy-- i=
ncentive compatible with the interests of the majority voters-- of a more l=
iberal migration policy. Effects of ageing on the tax and benefit sides of =
the welfare state depends on the size of dependents in the population and o=
n whether the country is a capital importer (in which case  the capital tax=
 burden is sha!
 red with foreigners) or a capital exporter (in which case the age-related =
wage increase skews taxation towards labor income). Low ageing evolution co=
rrelates with a relatively labor-abundant country (low retirement) turns in=
to labor-scarce country (high retirement). Parallel to the evolution of the=
 labor force, a capital-importer country (high rate of return) becomes capi=

 capital income taxation.

<p>
Smoking and obesity are the two leading causes of preventable deaths in the=
 United States. Because smoking is subject to heavy government intervention=
, understanding the effect of smoking on obesity is important in determinin=
g the extent of unintended costs or benefits of such intervention. The exis=
ting literature on this question is mixed among studies using experimental =
and observational data, which we attempt to reconcile by accounting for mis=
reporting in observational data. We use self-reported data from the Behavio=
ral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), cigarette taxes to instrument =
for changes in smoking, and survey completion to instrument for misreportin=
g. Starting with the baseline two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimator comm=
on in the earlier observational literature, we obtain similar estimates sug=
gesting quitting smoking substantially reduces BMI. However, we find the re=
sults are sensitive to specification, functional form, and the presence of =
misreporting. !
 We show that accounting for misreporting using the 2-step estimator develo=
ped by Nguimkeu et al. (2019) yields estimates consistent with the experime=
ntal literature; quitting smoking has a small positive effect on BMI. Our p=
referred estimate suggests reduced smoking accounts for 6% of the concurren=
t rise in obesity.

We study the nature of firm pay dynamics. To this end, we propose a statist=
ical model that extends the seminal framework by Abowd, Kramarz and Margoli=
s (1999) to allow for idiosyncratically time-varying firm pay policies. We =
estimate the model using linked employer-employee data for Sweden from 1985=
 to 2016. By drawing on detailed firm financials data, we show that firms t=
hat become more productive and accumulate capital raise pay, whereas firms =
lower pay as they add workers. A secular increase in firm-year pay dispersi=
on in Sweden since 1985 is accounted for by greater persistence of firm pay=
 among incumbent firms as well as greater dispersion in firm pay among entr=

We  use micro data from Orbis on firm level balance sheets and income state=

 dispersed, persistent, and negatively correlated with firm equity. We also=
 show that firms experience large, fat-tailed, and partly transitory change=

as from financial frictions which generate differences in financial returns=

As is well known, during the pandemic recession firms directly exposed to t=

Public health experts caution that legalization of recreational marijuana m=

 control policy.  However, very little is known about the impact of recreat=

our national datasets (National Survey of Drug Use and Health, Behavioral R=

ements, and Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health) and dynamic differ=
ence-in-differences and discrete-time hazard approaches, we find little sup=

Linear instrumental variable estimators, such as two-stage least squares (T=

We develop a decomposition that quantifies the extent to which the usual LA=

This paper proposes a tractable framework to analyze fiscal space and the d=

constraint. Without the ZLB, a greater primary deficit unambiguously raises=
 debt. However, debt need not explode: When R &lt; G =E2=80=93 =CF=86, wher=
e =CF=86 is the sensitivity of R =E2=80=93 G to debt, a modest permanent in=
crease in the deficit can be sustained forever, a policy we call =E2=80=9Cf=
ree lunch=E2=80=9D. With the ZLB, the relationship between deficit and debt=
 can become non-monotone. Both high and low deficits can increase debt, as =
the latter weaken demand and reduce nominal growth at the ZLB. A rise in in=
come inequality expands fiscal space outside the ZLB, but contracts it at t=
